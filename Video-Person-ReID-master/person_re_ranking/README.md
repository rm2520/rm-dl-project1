# Re-ranking Person Re-identification with k-reciprocal Encoding 
================================================================

### This code has the source code for the paper "Re-ranking Person Re-identification with k-reciprocal Encoding". Including:
1. IDE baseline
2. Re-ranking code
3. CUHK03 new training/testing protocol

### Two python version of re-ranking fcuntions are added in the 'python' folder.
1. re_ranking_feature.py: re-ranking with original feature, Euclidean distance is used. Thanks [Hao Luo](https://github.com/michuanhaohao) !
2. re_ranking_ranklist: re-ranking with given distance matrices, handle the difference of / division between python 2 and 3. Thanks [huang houjing](https://github.com/huanghoujing)  !

## IDE Baseline + Re-ranking

### Requirements: Caffe

Requirements for `Caffe` and `matcaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))

### Installation
1. Build Caffe and matcaffe
    ```Shell
    cd $Re-ranking_ROOT/caffe
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    # http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
    make -j8 && make matcaffe
    ```
    
2. Download pre-computed imagenet models, Market-1501 dataset and CUHK03 dataset
  ```Shell
  Please download the pre-trained imagenet models and put it in the "data/imagenet_models" folder.
  Please download Market-1501 dataset and unzip it in the "evaluation/data/Market-1501" folder. 
  Please download CUHK03 dataset and unzip it in the "evaluation/data/CUHK03" folder.
  ```

### Training and testing IDE model

1. Training 
  ```Shell
  cd $Re-ranking_ROOT
  # train IDE ResNet_50 for Market-1501
  ./experiments/Market-1501/train_IDE_ResNet_50.sh
  
  # train IDE ResNet_50 for CUHK03
  ./experiments/CUHK03/train_IDE_ResNet_50_labeled.sh
  ./experiments/CUHK03/train_IDE_ResNet_50_detected.sh
  ```
2. Feature Extraction
  ```Shell
  cd $Re-ranking_ROOT/evaluation
  # extract feature for Market-1501
  matlab Market_1501_extract_feature.m
  
  # extract feature for CUHK03
  matlab CUHK03_extract_feature.m
  ```
  
3. Evaluation
  ```Shell
  # evaluation for Market-1501
  matlab Market_1501_evaluation.m
    
  # evaluation for CUHK03
  matlab CUHK03_evaluation.m
  ``` 
  
### Results
You can download our pre-trained IDE models and IDE features, and put them in the "output"  and "evaluation/feat" folder, respectively. 

- IDE models [[Baiduyun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jHVj2C2) [[Google drive]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7TOZKXmIjU3ZTNsWGt3azcxUUU)

- IDE features [[Baiduyun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c1TtKcw) [[Google drive]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7TOZKXmIjU3ODhaRm8yN2QzRHc)

Using the above IDE models and IDE features, you can reproduce the results with our re-ranking method as follows:

- Market-1501

|Methods | Â  Rank@1 | mAP|
| --------   | -----  | ----  |
|IDE_ResNet_50  + Euclidean | 78.92% | 55.03%|
|IDE_ResNet_50  + Euclidean + re-ranking | 81.44% | 70.39%|
|IDE_ResNet_50  + XQDA      | 77.58% | 56.06%|
|IDE_ResNet_50  + XQDA + re-ranking     | 80.70% | 69.98%|

For Market-1501, these results are better than those reported in our paper, since we add a dropout = 0.5 layer after pool5.

- CUHK03 under  the new training/testing protocol
